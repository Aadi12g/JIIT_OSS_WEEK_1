parseAddition(): Requests the user to input two floating-point numbers (a and b), computes their sum (a + b), and displays the result.

parseSubtraction(): Prompts the user to enter two floating-point numbers (a and b), calculates their difference (a - b), and prints the result.

parseMultiplication(): Asks the user to input two floating-point numbers (a and b), performs their multiplication (a * b), and outputs the computed product.

parseDivision(): Prompts the user to enter two floating-point numbers (a and b). It performs division (a / b) if b is not zero; otherwise, it avoids division by zero and handles the error gracefully.

parseExponentiation(): Requests the user to enter a floating-point number (a) and an integer (b). It calculates a raised to the power of b (a^b) using the pow function from the <cmath> library and displays the result.

parseSquareRoot(): Prompts the user to input a floating-point number (a), computes its square root using the sqrt function from <cmath>, and then prints the result.
